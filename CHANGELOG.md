# Changelog for matter.js

This page shows a detailed overview of the changes between versions without the need to look into code, especially to see relevant changes while interfaces and features are still in flux.

The main work (all changes without a GitHub username in brackets in the below list) is done by the core team of this project completely in their free time (see their individual profiles for sponsoring options): @Apollon77, @lauckhart, @turon and @mfucci

## __WORK IN PROGRESS__

-   IMPORTANT: This release upgrades Matter support from Matter 1.3 to the latest release, Matter 1.4.0. This includes BREAKING CHANGES in a number of areas due to specification changes. For the most part these changes are transparent because they involve low-level APIs, implicit type names, or Matter features that were never adopted elsewhere. However, some small code changes may be necessary depending on how you use Matter.js or when Datatypes or elements got renamed.
    - Especially please note that `colorTempPhysicalMinMireds` and `colorTempPhysicalMaxMireds` now need to be set when using ColorControl because the former unrealistic default values were removed from the specification. Please set proper values for your device Hint: realistic color temperature Mireds values are usually roughly between 150 (6500K) and 500 (2000K).

-   chip-testing
    -   Feature: Added Chip-Tool compatible WebSocket Controller implementation to also run interop tests with matter.js controller

-   @matter/general
    - Breaking: `Logger.logger` is replaced with `Logger.destinations`.  Properties of individual destinations are slightly different.  A deprecated compability API should make this largely transparent
    - Feature: Logging destinations may process `Diagnostic.Message` directly and bypass matter.js's formatting
    - Feature: Log formatting is now extensible with custom formats
    - Feature: `QuietObservable` is an extended event source that emits events at reduced frequency based on configuration
    - Enhancement: Formalized concept of a logging "destination" and converted API for managing destinations to a simple object interface
    - Enhancement: Modifying log levels and format using the `Logger` static interface now updates defaults and applies changes to all destinations
    - Enhancement: Transaction participants no longer need implement commit-related methods if they do not participate in persistence
    - Enhancement: Missing IPv4 addresses on network interfaces are now ignored even if IPv4 is not disabled via configuration
    - Fix: Correctly handle MDNS records without QNames

-   @matter/main
    - Feature: Automatically handle basicInformation uniqueId Property as defined by specification if not set by the developer

-   @matter/nodejs
    - Fix: Improves async storage reliability and error handling to prevent empty storage files in crashing edge cases. With this change write actions need a bit longer but are more reliable, which mainly effects controller use cases when persisting the device attribute data on first subscribe

-   @matter/nodejs-shell
    - Feature: Added parameters `--qrCode` and `--qrCodeIndex` to the `commission pair` command to also use QR Code strings for pairing
    - Fix: Prevents crash on startup when having set a Fabric label in config

-   @matter/node
    - Breaking: `LevelControlServer` API has a few small changes that may affect device implementors.  Most notably the `setLevel` method is replaced with `transition` which handles both immediate and gradual level shifts
    - Feature: `Transitions` utility class offers a flexible API for implementing Matter attributes that change gradually at a constant rate
    - Feature: Attributes marked as `Q` (quieter) quality now support an extended `quiet` property that controls how often and when they emit.  By default `Q` attributes emit once per second
    - Feature: `LevelControlServer` performs smoother transitions with configurable transition step sizes and Matter 1.4-compliant event emitting.  It offers several new extension points for integrating with hardware and bridged devices
    - Enhancement: Event handling has received additional formality.  The node now ensures that async handlers register as tasks with the node.  Error logging contains more detail on the source of errors
    - Enhancement: `$Changed` events now run in a separate context from the emitter and errors will not interfere with the emitter

-   @matter/protocol
    - Breaking: `updateReceived()` callback on subscriptions is triggered after all updated data event are sent out.
    - Feature: Enhanced `getMultipleAttributesAndEvents()` to also return attributeStatus and eventStatus properties with errors returned from the read interaction 
    - Feature: Added `getMultipleAttributesAndStatus()` and `getMultipleEventsAndStatus()` to InteractionClient to allow to also returned attribute and event errors from the read interaction
    - Enhancement: Allows to access attributes, events and commands in CLusterClient instances also by their ID.
    - Fix: Makes sure to not Forward StatusResponseError cases that we generate locally to the device when not wanted
    - Fix: Enhances checks for Wi-Fi/Thread credentials in config for CommissioningFlow

-   @project-chip/matter.js
    - Breaking: Reduced exports to the relevant one for Controller usage. Please move for @matter/main for the rest.
    - Breaking: Remove the Legacy Device building API. Please use the new SeverNode based API which is more flexible and powerful.
    - Breaking: Changed signatures of `commissionNode()` and `createInteractionClient()` to provide options as object and not plain parameters
    - Breaking: The handling of the `requestFromRemote` parameter (first parameter) in get*Attribute methods in ClusterClients changed behavior! providing "false" will now never try to read from remote, "true" will always try to read from remote and "undefined" will use the default behavior (read from remote if not available locally or fabric scoped read). Only relevant if you used this parameter with value "false". Other use cases stay unchanged.
    - Feature: Allows to use a custom Root-NodeId, CertificateAuthority or CommissioningFlow implementation in the Controller
    - Feature: Allows to establish a secure PASE session to a device and use this to interact with the device in special pre-commissioning cases.

-   @project-chip/* packages (beside above)
    - Breaking: Packages are removed! Please use the new packages under @matter/* if needed

## 0.11.0 (2024-10-29)

-   IMPORTANT: As of 0.10.0 the @project-chip/matter.js module has grown quite large.  This release includes major refactoring that moves functional areas into independent NPM packages under the "@matter" org.  We have added exports to maintain backwards compatibility but these are not exhaustive.  In some cases you may need to update imports to reference new code locations.

-   Cross-module changes
    -   Info: Matter.js now uses aliases via `package.json` "imports" field.  This is an internal change that simplifies imports but should not affect consumers
    -   Info: Previously we used a mix of snake-case and CamelCase for sub-package exports.  We have now standardized on snake case.  Compatibility packages (see below) continue to support the original module names

-   @matter/general:
    -   Info: General functionality that is not Matter specific previously resided in `@project-chip/matter.js`.  It now lives in `@matter/general`
    -   BREAKING: The "ByteArray" type is removed, replaced with native-JS Uint8Array and a small collection of utility functions in the "Bytes" namespace
    -   Feature: The default "Time" implementation is now fully functional across all standard JS runtimes
    -   Enhancement: Network transports can now self select which the protocols and addresses they support
    -   Feature: A new `ObserverGroup` class simplifies binding management for multiple observables
    -   Feature: Introduced a new Async Disk key/Value-Storage compatible with the sync one driven by node-localstorage and uses it by default in new API and controller instances

-   @matter/main:
    -   Info: This package is a new "one-and-done" dependency for applications.  It automatically loads platform specialization and reexports packages above as appropriate

-   @matter/model:
    -   Info: The Matter object model previously exported as `@project-chip/matter.js/model` now resides in `@matter/model`
    -   Info: Individual elements exported by name are now models (fully functional classes) rather than elements (raw JSON data).  This should be backwards compatible but makes them more useful operationally

-   @matter/node:
    -   Info: The high-level APIs previously defined in `@project-chip/matter.js` now reside in `@matter/node`.  The Node API includes node management, behavior definitions and endpoint definitions
    -   Info: We export behaviors under `@matter/node/behaviors` or individually (e.g. `@matter/node/behaviors/on-off`)
    -   Info: We export device type definitions for system endpoints and devices under `@matter/node/endpoints` and `@matter/node/devices` respectively.  You may also import these via index or individually

-   @matter/nodejs:
    -   Info: Node.js specialization is moved here.  `@project-chip/matter-node.js` remains as a compatibility import.
    -   BREAKING: The previously deprecated re-exports in matter-node.js from matter.js are removed.

-   @matter/nodejs-ble
    -   Info: The BLE specialization for Node.js is moved here.  `@project-chip/matter-node-ble.js` remains as a compatibility import.
    -   Info: The noble and bleno dependencies got updated to also support Ubuntu 24

-   @matter/nodejs-shell:
    -   Breaking: The Shell Storage was moved to the new approach.  Please use "--legacyStorage" on startup to connect with the old storage to get into your old shell history and commissioned devices.  Storage migration guide see in the [README.md](./packages/nodejs-shell/README.md#matterjs-v011-storage-adjustment).
    -   Feature: Added new shell command "tlv" with TLV decoding and structure logging tooling  
    -   Enhancement: Added option to specify if attributes are loaded from remote or locally
    -   Enhancement: The shell now saves a 100 history of commands and restores this on startup
    -   Enhancement: Add a "nodes status" command to show the status of all nodes

-   @matter/protocol:
    -   Info: Low-level Matter logic previously defined in `@project-chip/matter.js` now resides in `@matter/protocol`.  This includes network communication, fabric management and cluster invocation, read/write, events, etc.
    -   BREAKING: Various types that were previously specialized with template parameters are no longer generic.  This should be largely transparent to API consumers.  Compatibility exports still support the generic parameters in some, but not all, cases.
    -   BREAKING: We have done some reorganization of lower-level implementation classes to improve implementation flexibility.  You probably do not use these classes directly so will be unaffected.
    -   Feature: New functional components including `DeviceCommissioner`, `DeviceAdvertiser`, `NodeFinder` and `Subscription` now perform functions that previously were in the (deprecated) MatterDevice class
    -   Enhancement: To simplify low-level configuration, many components in the protocol module now optionally retrieve dependencies from an Environment
    -   Enhancement: Limits the number of parallel exchanges to 5
    -   Enhancement: Uses the session timing details to calculate the timeout for subscription messages when received as client additionally to the subscription maxInterval
    -   Enhancement: Internal restructuring of Controller logic and setup. Introducing "peers" (commissioned node on a shared fabric)
    -   Fix: When subscribing with keepSubscriptions === false the existing subscriptions need to be removed earlier in the flow
    -   Fix: Clear resumption records also when fabric gets updated or deleted

-   @matter/types:
    -   Info: Various definitions previously defined in `@project-chip/matter.js` now reside in `@matter/types`.  This includes most TLV structures, cluster definitions, and various support types
    -   Info: Clusters are not exported in `@project-chip/matter.js`.  You can import via `@project-chip/types/clusters` or individually (e.g. `@project-chip/types/clusters/window-covering`)

-   @matter/examples:
    -   Enhancement: Adds a new example to show a PlugIn-Socket with Energy and Power measurement 

-   @matter/cli-tool:
    -   Feature: This new package offers a specialized JS environment for interacting with Matter and matter.js
    -   The "matter" command supports standard JS syntax and a "shell" style syntax that emulates common shell commands
    -   The virtual filesystem exposed by the tool allows you to navigate matter.js's packages and active subsystems
    -   This is an alpha feature.  We'll add command line control and additional functionality over time

-   @matter/create
    -   Feature: This new package bootstraps matter.js-based projects.
    -   For usage run `npm init @matter help` anywhere you have Node.js installed

-   Matter-Core functionality:
    -   Enhancement: Allow to discover VendorId + ProductId together optionally

-   matter.js clusters:
    -   Adds convenience helper method for ElectricalEnergyMeasurement cluster (usage see new example MeasuredSocketDevice) to set measurements and also trigger the needed events when imported and exported values changed in the measurement and events are required by specification
    
-   matter.js Controller API:
    -   Breaking: PairedNode instances are now created and directly returned also when the node is not et connected. This do not block code flows anymore for offline devices
    -   Breaking: Because of this  "getConnectedNode()" got renamed to "getPairedNode()"
    -   Breaking: "nodeState" property on PairedNode got renamed to "state"
    -   Breaking: Removed SupportedEventClient and UnknownSupportedEventClient and replaced by EventClient because EventList is provisional and was removed now (was not working for many devices anyway)
    -   Breaking: Removed ClusterClient methods isEventSupported and isEventSupportedByName because event lists are no longer available
    -   Deprecation: The attributeChangedCallback, eventTriggeredCallback and nodeStateChangedCallbacks are deprecated and replaced by new events "attributeChanged", "eventTriggered" and "stateChanged", "structureChanged" and "decommissioned" on PairedNode
    -   Feature: Some more data (like Network interfaces, PowerSources, Thread details) are collected and used when connecting to the nodes
    -   Feature: Based on device type the minimum and maximum subscription interval is now automatically set based on certain best practices. When multiple nodes are subscribed all Thread based devices are initialized by a "4 in parallel queue" to limit the used thread bandwidth.
    -   Feature: Subscribed attribute data are cached for each node and used on reconnects by utilizing dataVersionFilters on read and subscribes to reduce bandwidth on reconnects. The data are no (yet) persisted, so after Controller restart the data are collected anew.
    -   Feature: Low level InteractionClient API allows to enrich the attribute data that are not returned because of dataVersionFilters.
    -   Feature: Properly announces the controller node on start for devices to find the controller if needed and to utilize persisted subscriptions on device side 
    -   Enhancement: Only recreate PairedNode internal objects when structure really changed also on reconnects.
    -   Enhancement: Utilize more information (beside partList changes now also feature, serverList, attributeList, generatedCommandLists) as structure change to reinitialize objects.
    -   Enhancement: Huge refactoring in internal logic, optimized reconnection and rediscovery

## 0.10.0 (2024-08-31)

-   IMPORTANT: This release upgrades Matter support from Matter 1.1 to the latest release, Matter 1.3.0.1. This includes BREAKING CHANGES in a number of areas due to specification changes and some improvements in how we define datatypes. For the most part these changes are transparent because they involve low-level APIs, implicit type names, or Matter features that were never adopted elsewhere. However, some small code changes may be necessary depending on how you use Matter.js.

-   Matter.js Parser and Code generator:
    -   Feature: We now generate all Matter datatypes and elements. This includes some we defined by hand previously and those introduced by the Matter 1.2 and Matter 1.3 specifications.
    -   Feature: We now generate some datatypes that are not officially global or part of a specific cluster but are nevertheless defined in Matter specifications.
    -   Enhancement: Expanded dialect for conformance, constraint and "other quality" DSLs.
    -   Enhancement: Includes numerous code generation improvements.
-   Matter.js Matter Definition, Clusters, Schemas and Device-Types (independent of the used API)
    -   Breaking: Cluster revisions have increased and there are new mandatory elements for a few clusters. We have implemented these in places where we provide non-skeletal cluster implementations.
    -   Breaking: Previously we generated redundant definitions for struct, enum and bitmap types in *Interface.ts and *Cluster.ts files. We've eliminated those in the interface files.
    -   Breaking: Previously we generated redundant TLV and types for datatypes used by multiple clusters. We now only provide these types in their canonical location (globally or in the `ClusterName` namespace for the base cluster).
    -   Breaking: Some datatype names have changed to align with changes in the Matter specification and to make names more logical.
    -   Breaking: We've removed a few deprecated definitions for unused Matter elements such as the Scenes cluster.
    -   Breaking: Globals.ts previously defined core datatypes for the Matter object model. These are now generated and individually importable.
    -   Breaking: We've removed a few old draft datatypes defined in [connectedhomeip](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip) that were abandoned, renamed or are still "draft" as of Matter 1.3.
    -   Breaking: Some types related to ClusterServer are simplified.  This should be largely transparent but the template arguments are slightly different
    -   Feature: Adds all elements (clusters, attributes, events, commands, device types and datatypes) introduced in Matter 1.2 and Matter 1.3.
    -   Feature: Adds all Standard Namespaces defined by Matter 1.3 
-   Matter-Core functionality:
    -   Breaking: Removes the discovery capability "softAccessPoint" as it was removed from the Matter specification
    -   Breaking: Matter.js now requires node.js 18+
    -   Breaking: We now target ES 2022 for transpiled output.  We have not adopted new language features but this does mean that we generate true class properties now
    -   Breaking: We've removed the APIs `tryCatch` and `tryCatchAsync`.  These were used internally -- not part of any Matter related API -- but were exported
    -   Feature: Increase Data Model revision to 17 (introduced by Matter 1.2)
    -   Feature: Added Base64 encoding/decoding support to ByteArray
    -   Feature: Added WildcardPathFlagsBitmap to Attribute expansion for read/subscribe Interactions
    -   Feature: Added Matter 1.3 session params
    -   Feature: Added support for Multi-Invokes for Matter 1.3 (default for now are 10 invokes till we have a better value)
    -   Enhancement: Update Session parameters in PASE/CASE to match Matter 1.3 specification
    -   Enhancement: Removes TCP and ICD TXT records from MDNS responses because both currently not supported and optional to reduce the size of the MDNS responses
    -   Enhancement: Adds encoding and decoding of custom TlvData in QR-Codes including extensible Schema support for the defined Matter fields
    -   Enhancement: Optimizes Read and Subscribe handling for clients/controller to better match with specification
    -   Enhancement: Adds encoding/decoding support for multiple device information in one QR-Code
    -   Enhancement: Makes processing of manual Pairing codes more robust directly on decoding level
    -   Enhancement: Refactored Message size handling to dynamically calculate payload size based on transport capabilities
    -   Enhancement: Refactored and cleanup CASE and PASE and corrected handling in some places
    -   Enhancement: Added BTP Idle timeout as defined in Matter specification
    -   Enhancement: Enhanced default implementation of GeneralDiagnostics cluster with new convenience methods
    -   Enhancement: Many more protocol and functionality syncs with matter specification 1.3
    -   Enhancement: The Network methods that handles NetworkInterfaces are now "MaybePromise" to allow async implementations
    -   Enhancement/Fix: Several fixes and optimizations in Session and Message Exchange handling
    -   Enhancement/Fix: Adjusted MRP behavior with chip and only use/expect MRP ion unreliable channels (UDP). Fixes BLE commissioning
    -   Fix: Adjusted ValidationErrors to be more specific if they should return "InvalidAction" ot "ConstraintError".
    -   Fix: Adjusted some returned errors to be more specific and to the specification (e.g. InvalidAction instead of Failure)
    -   Fix: Fixed StandaloneAck handling to use an outstanding ack number as piggybacked ack number
    -   Fix: Makes sure subscription maxInterval cannot exceed the matter defined maximum of 60mins
    -   Fix: Synced attMtu handling with chip to always use MTU-3 bytes for BLE connections
-   matter.js API:
    -   Breaking: Node.start() is now asynchronous and returns when the node is online. This is only breaking in that lack of await will result in an unhandled rejection. Node.bringOnline() is deprecated.
    -   Feature: Adds default implementations for i18n clusters including Localization, Time Format Localization and Unit Localization.
    -   Feature: Adds interactionBegin and interactionEnd events for ClusterBehaviors to demarcate online interactions that mutate state.
    -   Feature: Any state value defined with schema is now configurable via the environment.
    -   Feature: You may now mark endpoints as "non-essential" to prevent errors from incapacitating a node.
    -   Feature: Utility device types are added automatically to the endpoints when the relevant clusters (like PowerSource or ElectricalSensor) are existing on the endpoint
    -   Feature: Adds DescriptorServer#addTag to make adding tags more convenient
    -   Feature: Modifies DescriptorServer#addDeviceType to accept device type name to simplify avoidance of cyclical dependencies
    -   Enhancement: Various Endpoint methods throw the root cause when there is an error rather than logging the root cause and throwing a less descriptive error.
    -   Enhancement: Explicitly defines DescriptorServer as an endpoint requirement so attributes are configurable in TS directly
-   matter.js Controller API:
    -   Breaking: commissionNode() in CommissioningController now returns the Node-ID and not the PairedNode instance.
    -   Breaking: AttributeClient now throws an exception when an attribute should be subscribed which is not reporting updates via subscriptions
    -   Feature: Adds PaseCommissioner to allow to execute the initial (PASE based) commissioning process separately from the operational completion of the commissioning process, also allowed to be BLE only.
    -   Feature: Allows to complete the commissioning process for a node where this process was started by a PASE commissioner
    -   Feature: Allows to commission a node without directly connecting to it
    -   Enhancement: Always read attributes that do not report changes via subscriptions (including all unknown Attributes)
    -   Fix: Skips network commissioning during commissioning when the commissioning is already using an IP based channel (like UDP)
    -   Fix: Fixes Node reconnection when disconnected before
    -   Fix: Makes sure to always use the BLE scanner when required
    -   Fix: Prevents reading subscribed attributes from remote if not requested and needed
    -   Fix: (digitaldan) Makes sure to re-use the same callbacks and options for a re-subscription of a Paired Node
-   matter.js Legacy API:
    -   Deprecation: We've deprecated the hand-generated device type definitions used by the pre-0.8.0 API in DeviceTypes.ts. These device type definitions remain at Matter 1.1.
    -   Removal: We removed old Scenes cluster implementation which was never fully implemented or used by any Matter controller
-   matter.js-react-native:
    -   Feature: Introduces new package to provides a React Native compatible platform Implementations for Matter.js. This package is still in development and not fully working and should be considered experimental for now! Currently it tries to support UDP, BLE, AsyncStorage and Crypto platform features. See [README](./packages/matter.js-react-native/README.md) for more information.
-   matter.js chip and python Testing:
    -   Includes updates and infrastructure improvements for Matter.js use of tests defined in [connectedhomeip](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip)
