# OnOff light example which logs the state changes to the console

This example shows how to run a Light device which is not configurable via CLI and only logs changes, so it is the most minimalistic example. It shows how to enhance the OnOff cluster server with own logic.

## Usage

For general documentation about the CLI parameters or environment variables that can be used for matter.js please refer to the [Examples README](../../../examples/README.md#cli-usage).

Execute the following command in the examples root directory

```bash
npm run matter-light
```
