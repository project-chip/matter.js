# OnOff light/socket device with a CLI command execution interface

This example shows how to build a simple minimalistic DeviceNode with just one socket or light endpoint. The shell commands to be executed by on/off commands can be configured via CLI.

## Usage

For general documentation about the CLI parameters or environment variables that can be used for matter.js please refer to the [Examples README](../../../examples/README.md#cli-usage).

To run from the build files:

```bash
matter-device
```

To run directly from Typescript files with on the fly compilation:

```bash
npm run matter-device
```

This starts a MatterServer (DeviceNode) server listening on port 5540 and announce it as socket device.

This first version only includes the OnOff cluster (on/off smart thing, like a plug or a bulb).
You can use -on and -off parameter to run a script to control something.
For instance, on a Raspberry Pi, this will turn on / off the red LED:

```bash
matter-device --type socket --on="echo 255 > /sys/class/leds/led1/brightness" --off="echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/led1/brightness"
```

or when starting from TS files:

```bash
npm run matter-device -- --type socket --on="echo 255 > /sys/class/leds/led1/brightness" --off="echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/led1/brightness"
```
(Please note the "--" to separate commandline parameters between the npm run and the executed script.

**If you want to start multiple parallel processes please make sure to use different storage locations, different network port and ideally also different passcodes for each process!**

The following parameters are available:
* --passcode: the passcode to use for pairing (default: 20202021)
* --discriminator: the discriminator to use for pairing (default: 3840, value between 0 and 4095)
* --vendorid: the vendor ID as number to use for pairing (default: 65521 (0xFFF1))
* --productid: the product ID as number to use for pairing (default: 32768 (0x8000))
* --uniqueid: a unique ID for this device to be used in naming and to store structure information (default: ms time now)
* --type: the device type to use for pairing (default: light, alternative value is "socket")
* --netinterface: limit mdns announcements and scanning to the provided network interface, e.g. "en0" (default: all interfaces available)
* --port: the port to listen on for the device (default: 5540)
* --store: the storage location (directory) to use for storing the pairing information (default: .device-node). Ideally use names starting with a ".". Delete the directory or provide an alternative name to reset the device
* --on: the command to run when the device is turned on (see example above)
* --off: the command to run when the device is turned off (see example above)

## Bundling

For production environments where space and/or CPU is at a premium, you might consider using a bundler to distribute your application.  This project includes an example demonstrating how to create such a bundle using [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/).

Then in the `matter-node.js-examples` installation directory, run:

```bash
npm run bundle-device
```

This creates a single JavaScript file containing the application and dependencies.

To view the example commands for bundling and running, see scripts `bundle-device` and `matter-device-bundled` in [package.json](../../package.json).

Note that you cannot include native dependencies in this way so those will still need to be installed locally using NPM.  In this example, those are the dependencies flagged as `--external` in the `esbuild` command line.
