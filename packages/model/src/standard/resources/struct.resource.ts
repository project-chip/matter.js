    details: "A struct is a sequence of fields of any data type. Individual fields are identified by a field ID of " +
        "unsigned integer, starting at 0 (zero), for the first field." +
        "\n" +
        "  • A struct itself shall have no constraint qualities." +
        "\n" +
        "  • Each struct field shall have its own qualities." +
        "\n" +
        "  • Access, conformance and persistence qualities, when not explicitly defined, shall be inherited " +
        "    from the instance of the struct itself." +
        "\n" +
        "  • Struct fields may have optional conformance." +
        "\n" +
        "  • A struct shall support reading and reporting of all fields." +

        "  • A struct shall support reporting changes to one or more fields." +

        "### Fabric-Scoped Struct" +

        "  • A fabric-scoped struct shall only be defined and occur as an entry in a fabric-scoped list." +
        "\n" +
        "  • A fabric-scoped struct shall support the global FabricIndex field of type fabric-index, which " +
        "    indicates the associated fabric of the struct, or indicates that there is no associated fabric." +
        "\n" +
        "  • The table that defines fields of a fabric-scoped struct shall NOT list the global FabricIndex " +
        "    field, which is a global field and defined implicitly." +

        "    struct." +
