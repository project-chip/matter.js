         *
         * On receipt of this command, the Node shall respond with a RetrieveLogsResponse command.
         *
         * If the RequestedProtocol is set to BDX the Node SHOULD immediately realize the RetrieveLogsResponse command

         * Node is able to fit the entirety of the requested logs within the LogContent field, the Status field of the
         * RetrieveLogsResponse shall be set to Exhausted and a BDX session shall NOT be initiated.

         * If the RequestedProtocol is set to BDX and either the Node does not support BDX or it is not possible for the
         * Node to establish a BDX session, then the Node shall utilize the LogContent field of the RetrieveLogsResponse
         * command to transfer as much of the current logs as it can fit within the response, and the Status field of
         * the RetrieveLogsResponse shall be set to Exhausted.
         *
         * If the RequestedProtocol is set to ResponsePayload the Node shall utilize the LogContent field of the
         * RetrieveLogsResponse command to transfer as much of the current logs as it can fit within the response, and a
         * BDX session shall NOT be initiated.
         *
         * If the RequestedProtocol is set to BDX and there is no TransferFileDesignator the command shall fail with a
         * Status Code of INVALID_COMMAND.
         *
         * If the Intent and/or the RequestedProtocol arguments contain invalid (out of range) values the command shall
