         * This field shall be present if it appears in a QueryImageResponse with a Status of UpdateAvailable.
         *
         * If the ImageURI specifies a BDX Protocol bdx: scheme, then the following rules describe the location to be
         * used for download:
         *
         *   1. The URI’s scheme field shall be exactly bdx in lowercase characters.
         *
         *   2. The URI’s authority field shall contain only the host portion and shall use string representation of the
         *      Operational Node ID of the Node where to proceed with the download, on the same Fabric on which the OTA
         *      Requestor received the QueryImageResponse.
         *
         *   3. The encoding of the Node ID in the host field shall use an uppercase hexadecimal format, using exactly
         *      16 characters to encode the network byte order value of the NodeID, in a similar fashion as the Node
         *      Identifier portion of the Operational Instance Name.
         *
         *     a. The Operational Node ID in the host field shall match the NodeID of the OTA Provider responding with
         *        the QueryImageResponse. The usage of a different Node ID than that of the provider is reserved for
         *        future use. This constraint reduces the number of independent CASE secure channel sessions that have
         *        to be maintained to proceed with OTA software updates, thus reducing energy and resource utilization
         *        for the software update process.
         *
         *   4. The user section of the authority field shall be absent, as there are no "users" to be considered.
         *
         *   5. The port section of the authority field shall be absent, as the port for transport shall be determined
         *      through Operational Discovery of the target Node.
         *
         *   6. The URI shall NOT contain a query field.
         *
         *   7. The URI shall NOT contain a fragment field.
         *
         *   8. The path field shall employ absolute path representation and shall contain the file designator of the
         *      software image to download at the BDX server. When used with the BDX server, the leading / separating
         *      the URI authority from the path shall be omitted. When contacting the BDX server, further processing of
         *      the file designator shall NOT be done, including handling of URL-encoded escape sequences. Rather, the
         *      exact octets of the path, as received shall be the values used by both client and server in handling the
         *      file designator.
         *
         *     a. The path shall only contain valid URI characters.
         *
         * These rules above for BDX URIs simplify parsing for OTA Requestors receiving Image URIs. The following
         * example procedure shows how the format constraints simplify the extraction of the necessary data to reach the
         * BDX server for download.
         *
         *   1. Verify that the URI is 24 characters or longer, which is the minimum length of a valid BDX URI with all
         *      elements present, for example bdx://00112233AABBCCDD/0.
         *
         *   2. Verify the presence of prefix bdx:// indicating a BDX URI.
         *
         *   3. Extract the next 16 characters and convert from uppercase hexadecimal to a 64-bit scalar value,
         *      considering network byte order. This is the destination Node ID.
         *
         *   4. Verify the presence of a path separator / and skip it.
         *
         *   5. Extract the remaining characters of the string as the file designator to employ when initiating the BDX
         *      transfer.
