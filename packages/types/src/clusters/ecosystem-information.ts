     * The Ecosystem Information Cluster provides extended device information for all the logical devices represented by
     * a Bridged Node. The Ecosystem Information Cluster presents the view of device name and location metadata for
     * presentation by a client of the cluster to a user. This cluster is intended to support Fabric Synchronization and
     * be present on an endpoint with the BridgedNode device type listed in the DeviceTypeList of the endpoint’s
     * Descriptor cluster.
     *
     * This augments the Bridged Device Basic Information Cluster in the following ways:
     *
     *   • The Ecosystem Information Cluster adds support for providing a name and location for individual endpoints.
     *     (The endpoints do not need to be present on the Bridge for their name and location information to be
     *     present.)
     *
     *   • The Ecosystem Information Cluster adds metadata to support conflict resolution between multiple sources of
     *     the name and location data.
     *
     *   • The Ecosystem Information Cluster supports user control for the presence of the name and location information
     *     by specifying more restricted access.
     *
     * A client SHOULD use the information provided by the Ecosystem Information Cluster to help the user organize and
     * interact with their devices. Some examples may include:
     *
     *   • Directly organizing and labeling the devices in a client’s user interface.
     *
     *   • Providing hints in the user interface, which can assist the user in organizing and labeling their devices.
     *
     * For the purposes of the Ecosystem Information Cluster section, an instance of the Ecosystem Information Cluster
     * will be referred to as an "instance".
