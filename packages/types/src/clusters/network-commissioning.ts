         *
         * If the Networks attribute does not contain a matching entry, the command shall immediately respond with
         * NetworkConfigResponse having NetworkingStatus status field set to NetworkIdNotFound.

         * field set to OutOfRange.

         * the entry in the Networks attribute that was just updated, matching the incoming NetworkIndex, and a
         * NetworkingStatus status field set to Success.
         *
         * The entry selected shall be inserted at the new position in the list. All other entries, if any exist, shall
         * be moved to allow the insertion, in a way that they all retain their existing relative order between each
         * other, with the exception of the newly re-ordered entry.
         *
         * Re-ordering to the same NetworkIndex as the current location shall be considered as a success and yield no
         * visible changes of the Networks attribute.
         *
         * ### Examples of re-ordering
         *
         * To better illustrate the re-ordering operation, consider this initial state, exemplary of a Wi-Fi device:
         *
         * On receiving ReorderNetwork with:
         *
         *   • NetworkID = Home-Guest
         *
         *   • NetworkIndex = 0
         *
         * The outcome, after applying to the initial state would be:
         *
         * In the above outcome, FancyCat and BlueDolphin moved "down" and Home-Guest became the highest priority
         * network in the list.
         *
         * On receiving ReorderNetwork with:
         *
         *   • NetworkID = FancyCat
         *
         *   • NetworkIndex = 3
         *
         * The outcome, after applying to the initial state would be:
         *
         * In the above outcome, BlueDolphin, Home-Guest and WillowTree moved "up" and FancyCat became the lowest
         * priority network in the list.

             * This command shall attempt to connect to a network whose configuration was previously added by either the
             * AddOrUpdateWiFiNetwork or AddOrUpdateThreadNetwork commands. Network is identified by its NetworkID.
             *
             * This command shall fail with a BUSY status code returned to the initiator if the server is currently
             * unable to proceed with such an operation, such as if it is currently attempting to connect in the
             * background, or is already proceeding with a prior ConnectNetwork.
             *
             * If this command is received without an armed fail-safe context (see ArmFailSafe), then this command shall
             * fail with a FAILSAFE_REQUIRED status code sent back to the initiator.
             *
             * Before connecting to the new network, the Node shall disconnect the operational network connections
             * managed by any other Network Commissioning cluster instances (whether under the Root Node or a Secondary
             * Network Interface), where those connections are not represented by an entry in the Networks attribute of
             * the corresponding cluster instance. This ensures that an Administrator or Commissioner can reliably
             * reconfigure the operational network connection of a device that has one or more Secondary Network
             * interfaces, for example by removing the active network configuration from one cluster instance, followed
             * by adding a new configuration and calling ConnectNetwork on a different cluster instance.
             *
             * Success or failure of this command shall be communicated by the ConnectNetworkResponse command, unless
             * some data model validations caused a FAILURE status to be sent prior to finishing execution of the
             * command. The ConnectNetworkResponse shall indicate the value Success in the NetworkingStatus field on
             * successful connection. On failure to connect, the ConnectNetworkResponse shall contain an appropriate
             * NetworkingStatus, DebugText and ErrorValue indicating the reason for failure.
             *
             * The amount of time needed to determine successful or failing connectivity on the cluster server’s
             * associated interface is provided by the ConnectMaxTimeSeconds attribute. Clients shall NOT consider the
             * connection to have timed-out until at least that duration has taken place. For non-concurrent
             * commissioning situations, the client SHOULD allow additional margin of time to account for its delay in
             * executing operational discovery of the Node once it is connected to the new network.
             *
             * On successful connection, the entry associated with the given Network configuration in the Networks
             * attribute shall indicate its Connected field set to true, and all other entries, if any exist, shall
             * indicate their Connected field set to false.
             *
             * On failure to connect, the entry associated with the given Network configuration in the Networks
             * attribute shall indicate its Connected field set to false.
             *
             * The precedence order of any entry subject to ConnectNetwork shall NOT change within the Networks
             * attribute.
             *
             * Even after successfully connecting to a network, the configuration shall revert to the prior state of
             * configuration if the CommissioningComplete command (see CommissioningComplete) is not successfully
             * invoked before expiry of the Fail-Safe timer.
             *
             * When non-concurrent commissioning is being used by a Commissioner or Administrator, the
             * ConnectNetworkResponse shall be sent with the NetworkingStatus field set to Success prior to closing the
             * commissioning channel, even if not yet connected to the operational network, unless the device would be
             * incapable of joining that network, in which case the usual failure path described in the prior paragraphs
             * shall be followed. Once the commissioning channel is closed, the operational channel will be started. It
             * is possible that the only method to determine success of the operation is operational discovery of the
             * Node on the new operational network. Therefore, before invoking the ConnectNetwork command, the client
             * SHOULD re-invoke the Arm Fail-Safe command with a duration that meets the following:
             *
             *   1. Sufficient time to meet the minimum required time (see ConnectMaxTimeSeconds) that may be taken by
             *      the server to connect to the desired network.
             *
             *   2. Sufficient time to account for possible message-layer retries when a response is requested.
             *
             *   3. Sufficient time to allow operational discovery on the new network by a Commissioner or
             *      Administrator.
             *
             *   4. Sufficient time to establish a CASE session after operational discovery
             *
             *   5. Not so long that, in error situations, the delay to reverting back to being discoverable for
             *      commissioning with a previous configuration would cause significant user-perceived delay.
             *
             * Note as well that the CommissioningTimeout duration provided in a prior OpenCommissioningWindow or
             * OpenBasicCommissioningWindow command may impact the total time available to proceed with error recovery
             * after a connection failure.
             *
             * The LastNetworkingStatus, LastNetworkID and LastConnectErrorValue attributes may assist the client in
             * determining the reason for a failure after reconnecting over a Commissioning channel, especially in
             * non-concurrent commissioning situations.

     * include the following types.
     *
     *   • Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11-2020)
     *
     *   • Ethernet (802.3)
     *
     *   • Thread (802.15.4)

     * An instance of the Network Commissioning Cluster only applies to a single network interface instance present. An
     * interface, in this context, is a unique entity that can have an IPv6 address assigned to it and ingress and
     * egress IP packets.
     *
     * Per the Matter specification you cannot use {@link NetworkCommissioningCluster} without enabling certain feature
     * combinations. You must use the {@link with} factory method to obtain a working cluster.
