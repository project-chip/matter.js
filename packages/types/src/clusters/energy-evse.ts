     * Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE) is equipment used to charge an Electric Vehicle (EV) or Plug-In Hybrid
     * Electric Vehicle. This cluster provides an interface to the functionality of Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment
     * (EVSE) management.
     *
     * Devices targeted by this cluster include Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE). The cluster generically
     * assumes a signaling protocol (J1772 in NA and IEC61851 in Europe and Asia) between the EVSE and Electric Vehicle
     * (EV) that utilizes a pilot signal to manage the states of the charging process. [SAE J2847/3_202311] version and
     * IEC61841 define Pilot signal as a modulated DC voltage on a single wire.
     *
     * Power Line Communication (PLC) is supported by some EVSEs (e.g. for support of ISO 15118 in Europe and SAE
     * J2931/4 in NA) and may enable features such as Vehicle to Grid (V2G) or Vehicle to Home (V2H) that allows for
     * bi-directional charging/discharging of electric vehicles.
     *
     * More modern EVSE devices may optionally support ISO 15118-20 in Europe and SAE J2836/3 for NA to support
     * bi-directional charging (Vehicle to Grid - V2G) and Plug and Charge capabilities.
     *
     * This cluster definition assumes AC charging only. DC charging options may be added in future revisions of this
     * cluster.
     *
     * This cluster supports a safety mechanism that may lockout remote operation until the initial latching conditions
     * have been met. Some of the fault conditions defined in SAE J1772, such as Ground-Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI)
     * or Charging Circuit Interrupting Device (CCID), may require clearing by an operator by, for example, pressing a
     * button on the equipment or breaker panel.
     *
     * This EVSE cluster is written around support of a single EVSE. Having multiple EVSEs at home or a business is
     * managed by backend system and outside scope of this cluster.
     *
     * Note that in many deployments the EVSE may be outside the home and may suffer from intermittent network
     * connections (e.g. a weak WiFi signal). It also allows for a charging profile to be pre-configured, in case there
     * is a temporary communications loss during a charging session.
     *
     * EnergyEvseCluster supports optional features that you can enable with the EnergyEvseCluster.with() factory
     * method.
     *
