         * PowerForecastReporting (PFR)
         *
         * For Energy Smart Appliances (ESA) the definition of being 'smart' implies that they can report their
         * indicative forecast power demands or generation, to a greater or lesser extent. For some ESAs this is highly
         * predictable (in terms of both power and time), in other appliances this is more challenging and only a basic
         * level of forecast is possible.
         *
         * Forecasts are defined from a current time, using a slot format, where the slot is akin to a relatively
         * constant operating mode.
         *
         * In some circumstances the ESA may allow the stage to be delayed or paused (subject to safety and
         * manufacturer’s discretion and user preferences).
         *
         * Typically, appliances with a heating element cannot have their power consumption adjusted and can only be
         * paused or delayed.
         *
         * Some ESAs may not be flexible other than a delayed cycle start (for example, once the washing cycle has been
         * started then they run continuously until the cycle completes).
         *
         * Appliances that only support the PowerForecastReporting and not any of the adjustment features may indicate
         * that they are not flexible in the forecast slot format.
         *
         * The PowerForecastReporting and the adjustment features aim to align to the [SAREF4ENER] ontology.
         *
         * For example, a single phase EVSE can be adjusted in the range of 6-32Amps in 0.6 Amp steps in EU or on a
         * hardwired 120V supply in the range of 6-15 Amps in US.
         *
         * For example, a home battery may be adjusted to charge or discharge in steps of 1W.
         *
         * For example, a heat pump may be able to modulate its compressor inverter between 20-100% of its rated power.
         *
         * The ESA indicates its power adjustment range and its nominal power consumption as part of its Forecast.

             * highly predictable (in terms of both power and time), in other appliances this is more challenging and
             * only a basic level of forecast is possible.
             *
             * Forecasts are defined from a current time, using a slot format, where the slot is akin to a relatively
             * constant operating mode.
             *
             * In some circumstances the ESA may allow the stage to be delayed or paused (subject to safety and
             * manufacturer’s discretion and user preferences).
             *
             * Typically, appliances with a heating element cannot have their power consumption adjusted and can only be
             * paused or delayed.
             *
             * Some ESAs may not be flexible other than a delayed cycle start (for example, once the washing cycle has
             * been started then they run continuously until the cycle completes).
             *
             * Appliances that only support the PowerForecastReporting and not any of the adjustment features may
             * indicate that they are not flexible in the forecast slot format.
             *
             * The PowerForecastReporting and the adjustment features aim to align to the [SAREF4ENER] ontology.
             *
             * For example, a single phase EVSE can be adjusted in the range of 6-32Amps in 0.6 Amp steps in EU or on a
             * hardwired 120V supply in the range of 6-15 Amps in US.
             *
             * For example, a home battery may be adjusted to charge or discharge in steps of 1W.
             *
             * For example, a heat pump may be able to modulate its compressor inverter between 20-100% of its rated
             * power.
             *
             * The ESA indicates its power adjustment range and its nominal power consumption as part of its Forecast.

    /**
     * This cluster allows a client to manage the power draw of a device. An example of such a client could be an Energy
     * Management System (EMS) which controls an Energy Smart Appliance (ESA).
     *
     * In most deployments the EMS will be the client, and the ESA will host the Device Energy Management Cluster
     * server.
     *
     * This cluster is intended to be generic in nature and could apply to any electrical load or generator (e.g. a
     * Battery Electric Storage System - BESS, solar PV inverter, EVSE, HVAC, heat pump, hot water heater, white goods
     * appliances etc).
     *
     * It consists of the following areas which shall be supported by all devices implementing this cluster:
     *
     *   • Description of ESA and its capabilities & power limits (sometimes referred to as a nameplate)
     *
     *   • Current state of operation (including user opt-out, safety limitations / alarms) There are some optional
     *     capabilities that some ESAs may be able to offer:
     *
     *   • Ability to control the load or generation
     *
     *   • Forecast data, including when it can be flexible (i.e. modify the power or time period)
     *
     *   • The ability to have their power profile adjusted by an EMS, and to provide an updated Forecast back to the
     *     EMS.
     *
     * This allows the EMS to manage multiple home loads and where ESAs can be flexible, continuously optimizing the
     * home energy to minimize cost, reduce CO2 impact, maximize self-consumption of solar PV and provide Demand Side
     * Response (DSR) Grid services.
     *
     * It is likely that the ESA may also use the Pricing Cluster to obtain incentive signals such as 'grid carbon
     * intensity', 'time of use' or 'type of use' tariffs to schedule its operation to run at the cheapest and greenest
     * times.
     *
     * > [!NOTE]
     *
     * > Grid Services are market dependent and will use other protocols ([OpenADR] / [IEEE2030.5]) to communicate grid
     *   events to the EMS. These are outside the scope of Matter.
     *
     * > [!NOTE]
     *
     * > Different markets may follow different approaches, but the UK [PAS1878] and [EUCodeOfConduct] give examples of
     *   how ESAs may be mandated to support these features in the future.
     *
     * Per the Matter specification you cannot use {@link DeviceEnergyManagementCluster} without enabling certain
     * feature combinations. You must use the {@link with} factory method to obtain a working cluster.
     *
     * @see {@link MatterSpecification.v141.Cluster} § 9.2
