         * ManagedDevice (MNGD)
         *
         * This feature is for a device that is managed by a service associated with the device vendor and which imposes
         * default access restrictions upon each new fabric added to it. This could arise, for example, if the device is
         * managed by a service provider under contract to an end-user, in such a way that the manager of the device
         * does not unconditionally grant universal access to all of a device’s functionality, even for fabric
         * administrators. For example, many Home Routers are managed by an Internet Service Provider (a service), and
         * these services often have a policy that requires them to obtain user consent before certain administrative
         * functions can be delegated to a third party (e.g., a fabric Administrator). These restrictions are expressed
         * using an Access Restriction List (ARL).
         *
         * The purpose of this feature on the Access Control cluster is to indicate to a fabric Administrator that
         * access by it to specific attributes, commands and/or events for specific clusters is currently prohibited.
         * Attempts to access these restricted data model elements shall result in an error of ACCESS_RESTRICTED.
         *
         * A device that implements this feature shall have a mechanism to honor the ReviewFabricRestrictions command,
         * such as user interfaces or service interactions associated with a service provider or the device
         * manufacturer, which allows the owner (or subscriber) to manage access restrictions for each fabric. The user
         * interface design, which includes the way restrictions are organized and presented to the user, is not
         * specified, but SHOULD be usable by non-expert end-users from common mobile devices, personal computers, or an
         * on-device user interface.
         *
         * Controllers and clients SHOULD incorporate generic handling of the ACCESS_RESTRICTED error code, when it
         * appears in allowed contexts, in order to gracefully handle situations where this feature is encountered.
         * Device vendors that adopt this feature SHOULD be judicious in its use given the risk of unexpected behavior
         * in controllers and clients.
         *
         * For certification testing, a device that implements this feature shall provide a way for all restrictions to
         * be removed.
         *
         * The ARL attribute provides the set of restrictions currently applied to this fabric.
         *
         * The ReviewFabricRestrictions command provides a way for the fabric Administrator to request that the server
         * triggers a review of the current fabric restrictions, by involving external entities such as end-users, or
         * other services associated with the manager of the device hosting the server. This review process may involve
         * communication between external services and the user, and may take an unpredictable amount of time to
         * complete since an end-user may need to visit some resources, such as a mobile application or web site. A
         * FabricRestrictionReviewUpdate event will be generated by the device within a predictable time period of the
         * ReviewFabricRestrictionsResponse (see ReviewFabricRestrictions for specification of this time period), and
         * this event can be correlated with the ReviewFabricRestrictionsResponse using a token provided in both. The
         * device may provide instructions or a Redirect URL in the FabricRestrictionReviewUpdate event in order to help
         * the user access the features required for managing per-fabric restrictions.
         *
         * See Section 6.6.2, “Model” for a description of how access control is impacted by the ARL attribute.
         *
         * ### Managed Device Feature Usage Restrictions
         *
         * Use of this feature shall be limited to the mandatory clusters of endpoints having a device type that
         * explicitly permits its use in the Device Library Specification. As a reminder, the device types associated
         * with an endpoint are listed in the Descriptor cluster of the endpoint.
         *
         * In addition, use of this feature shall NOT restrict the following clusters on any endpoint:
         *
         *   1. the Descriptor Cluster (0x001D)
         *
         *   2. the Binding Cluster (0x001E)
         *
         *   3. the Network Commissioning Cluster (0x0031)
         *
         *   4. the Identify Cluster (0x0003)
         *
         *   5. the Groups Cluster (0x0004)
         *
         * In addition, use of this feature shall NOT restrict the global attributes of any cluster.
         *
         * Because ARLs cannot be used to restrict root node access or access to any clusters required for
         * commissioning, administrators may determine the current restrictions of the ARL at any point, including
         * during commissioning after joining the fabric.
         *

         *     ◦ This flow typically requires internet access to access the URL, and access extension may fail when
         *       internet connectivity is not available.
         *
         *     ◦ If the flow prefers to redirect the user to an app which is available on popular platforms, it SHOULD
         *       also provide a fallback option such as a web browser interface to ensure users can complete access
         *       extension.
         *
         * ### ARLRequestFlowUrl format
         *
         * The ARLRequestFlowUrl shall contain a query component (see RFC 3986 section 3.4) composed of one or more
         * key-value pairs:
         *
         *   • The query shall use the & delimiter between key/value pairs.
         *
         *   • The key-value pairs shall in the format name=<value> where name is the key name, and <value> is the
         *     contents of the value encoded with proper URL-encoded escaping.
         *
         *   • If key MTcu is present, it shall have a value of "_" (i.e. MTcu=_). This is the "callback URL
         *     (CallbackUrl) placeholder".
         *
         *   • Any key whose name begins with MT not mentioned in the previous bullets shall be reserved for future use
         *     by this specification. Manufacturers shall NOT include query keys starting with MT in the
         *     ARLRequestFlowUrl unless they are referenced by a version of this specification.
         *
         * Any other element in the ARLRequestFlowUrl query field not covered by the above rules, as well as the
         * fragment field (if present), shall remain including the order of query key/value pairs present.
         *
         * Once the URL is obtained, it shall be expanded to form a final URL (ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl) by proceeding
         * with the following substitution algorithm on the original ARLRequestFlowUrl:
         *
         *   1. If key MTcu is present, compute the CallbackUrl desired (see Section 9.10.9.3.5, “CallbackUrl format for
         *      ARL Request Flow response”), and substitute the placeholder value "_" (i.e. in MTcu=_) in the
         *      ARLRequestFlowUrl with the desired contents, encoded with proper URL-encoded escaping (see RFC 3986
         *      section 2).
         *
         * The final URL after expansion (ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl) shall be the one to follow, rather than the
         * original value obtained from the FabricRestrictionReviewUpdate event.
         *
         * ### CallbackUrl format for ARL Request Flow response
         *
         * If a CallbackUrl field (i.e. MTcu=) query field placeholder is present in the ARLRequestFlowUrl, the client
         * may replace the placeholder value "_" in the ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl with a URL that the manufacturer flow
         * can use to make a smooth return to the client when the ARL flow has terminated.
         *
         * This URL field may contain a query component (see RFC 3986 section 3.4). If a query is present, it shall be
         * composed of one or more key-value pairs:
         *
         *   • The query shall use the & delimiter between key/value pairs.
         *
         *   • The key-value pairs shall follow the format name=<value> where name is the key name, and <value> is the
         *     contents of the value encoded with proper URL-encoded escaping.
         *
         *   • If key MTaer is present, it shall have a value of "_" (i.e. MTaer=_). This is the placeholder for a
         *     "access extension response" provided by the manufacturer flow to the client. The manufacturer flow shall
         *     replace this placeholder with the final status of the access extension request, which shall be formatted
         *     following Expansion of CallbackUrl by the manufacturer custom flow and encoded with proper URL-encoded
         *     escaping.
         *
         *   • Any key whose name begins with MT not mentioned in the previous bullets shall be reserved for future use
         *     by this specification.
         *
         * Any other element in the CallbackUrl query field not covered by the above rules, as well as the fragment
         * field (if present), shall remain as provided by the client through embedding within the
         * ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl, including the order of query key/value pairs present.
         *
         * Once the CallbackUrl is obtained by the manufacturer flow, it may be expanded to form a final
         * ExpandedARLRequestCallbackUrl URL to be used by proceeding with the following substitution algorithm on the
         * provided CallbackUrl:
         *
         *   • If key MTaer is present, the manufacturer custom flow having received the initial query containing the
         *     CallbackUrl shall substitute the placeholder value "_" (i.e. in MTaer=_) in the CallbackUrl with the
         *     final status of the access extension request flow which shall be one of the following. Any value returned
         *     in the MTaer field not listed above shall be considered an error and shall be treated as GeneralFailure.
         *
         *     ◦ Success - The flow completed successfully and the ARL attribute was updated. The client may now read
         *       the ARL attribute to determine the new access restrictions.
         *
         *     ◦ NoChange - The ARL attribute was already listing minimum restrictions for the requesting fabric.
         *
         *     ◦ GeneralFailure - The flow failed for an unspecified reason.
         *
         *     ◦ FlowAuthFailure - The user failed to authenticate to the flow.
         *
         *     ◦ NotFound - Access extension failed because the target fabric was not found.
         *
         * A manufacturer custom flow having received an ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl SHOULD attempt to open the
         * ExpandedARLRequestCallbackUrl, on completion of the request, if an ExpandedARLRequestCallbackUrl was computed
         * from the CallbackUrl and opening such a URL is supported.
         *
         * ### Examples of ARLRequestFlowUrl URLs
         *
         * Below are some examples of valid ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl for several valid values of ARLRequestFlowUrl, as
         * well as some examples of invalid values of ARLRequestFlowUrl:
         *
         *   • Invalid URL with no query string: http scheme is not allowed:
         *
         *     ◦ http://company.domain.example/matter/arl/vFFF1p1234
         *
         *   • Valid URL :
         *
         *     ◦ https://company.domain.example/matter/arl/vFFF1p1234
         *
         *   • Valid URL, CallbackUrl requested:
         *
         *     ◦ Before expansion:
         *
         * https://company.domain.example/matter/arl?vid=FFF1&pid=1234&MTcu=_
         *
         *   ◦ After expansion: https://company.domain.example/matter/arl?vid=FFF1&pid=1234&MTcu=https%3A%2F%2Fc
         *     lient.domain.example%2Fcb%3Ftoken%3DmAsJ6_vqbr-vjDiG_w%253D%253D%26MTaer%3D_
         *
         *   ◦ The ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl URL contains:
         *
         *     ▪ A CallbackUrl with a client-provided arbitrary token= key/value pair and the MTaer= key/value pair
         *       place-holder to indicate support for a return access extension completion status:
         *       https://client.domain.example/cb?token=mAsJ6_vqbr-vjDiG_w%3D%3D&MTaer=_
         *
         *     ▪ After expansion of the CallbackUrl (MTcu key) into an ExpandedCallbackUrl, with an example return
         *       access extension completion status of Success, the ExpandedARLRequestCallbackUrl would be:
         *
         * https://client.domain.example/cb?token=mAsJ6_vqbr-vjDiG_w%3D%3D&MTaer=Success
         *
         * Note that the MTcu key/value pair was initially provided URL-encoded within the ExpandedARLRequestFlowUrl URL
         * and the MTaer=_ key/value pair placeholder now contains a substituted returned completion status.
         *
         *   • Invalid URL, due to MTza=79 key/value pair in reserved MT-prefixed keys reserved for future use:
         *
         *     ◦ https://company.domain.example/matter/arl?vid=FFF1&pid=1234&MTop=_&MTza=79

             * This feature is for a device that is managed by a service associated with the device vendor and which
             * imposes default access restrictions upon each new fabric added to it. This could arise, for example, if
             * the device is managed by a service provider under contract to an end-user, in such a way that the manager
             * of the device does not unconditionally grant universal access to all of a device’s functionality, even
             * for fabric administrators. For example, many Home Routers are managed by an Internet Service Provider (a
             * service), and these services often have a policy that requires them to obtain user consent before certain
             * administrative functions can be delegated to a third party (e.g., a fabric Administrator). These
             * restrictions are expressed using an Access Restriction List (ARL).
             *
             * The purpose of this feature on the Access Control cluster is to indicate to a fabric Administrator that
             * access by it to specific attributes, commands and/or events for specific clusters is currently
             * prohibited. Attempts to access these restricted data model elements shall result in an error of
             * ACCESS_RESTRICTED.
             *
             * A device that implements this feature shall have a mechanism to honor the ReviewFabricRestrictions
             * command, such as user interfaces or service interactions associated with a service provider or the device
             * manufacturer, which allows the owner (or subscriber) to manage access restrictions for each fabric. The
             * user interface design, which includes the way restrictions are organized and presented to the user, is
             * not specified, but SHOULD be usable by non-expert end-users from common mobile devices, personal
             * computers, or an on-device user interface.
             *
             * Controllers and clients SHOULD incorporate generic handling of the ACCESS_RESTRICTED error code, when it
             * appears in allowed contexts, in order to gracefully handle situations where this feature is encountered.
             * Device vendors that adopt this feature SHOULD be judicious in its use given the risk of unexpected
             * behavior in controllers and clients.
             *
             * For certification testing, a device that implements this feature shall provide a way for all restrictions
             * to be removed.
             *
             * The ARL attribute provides the set of restrictions currently applied to this fabric.
             *
             * The ReviewFabricRestrictions command provides a way for the fabric Administrator to request that the
             * server triggers a review of the current fabric restrictions, by involving external entities such as
             * end-users, or other services associated with the manager of the device hosting the server. This review
             * process may involve communication between external services and the user, and may take an unpredictable
             * amount of time to complete since an end-user may need to visit some resources, such as a mobile
             * application or web site. A FabricRestrictionReviewUpdate event will be generated by the device within a
             * predictable time period of the ReviewFabricRestrictionsResponse (see ReviewFabricRestrictions for
             * specification of this time period), and this event can be correlated with the
             * ReviewFabricRestrictionsResponse using a token provided in both. The device may provide instructions or a
             * Redirect URL in the FabricRestrictionReviewUpdate event in order to help the user access the features
             * required for managing per-fabric restrictions.
             *
             * See Section 6.6.2, “Model” for a description of how access control is impacted by the ARL attribute.
             *
             * ### Managed Device Feature Usage Restrictions
             *
             * Use of this feature shall be limited to the mandatory clusters of endpoints having a device type that
             * explicitly permits its use in the Device Library Specification. As a reminder, the device types
             * associated with an endpoint are listed in the Descriptor cluster of the endpoint.
             *
             * In addition, use of this feature shall NOT restrict the following clusters on any endpoint:
             *
             *   1. the Descriptor Cluster (0x001D)
             *
             *   2. the Binding Cluster (0x001E)
             *
             *   3. the Network Commissioning Cluster (0x0031)
             *
             *   4. the Identify Cluster (0x0003)
             *
             *   5. the Groups Cluster (0x0004)
             *
             * In addition, use of this feature shall NOT restrict the global attributes of any cluster.
             *
             * Because ARLs cannot be used to restrict root node access or access to any clusters required for
             * commissioning, administrators may determine the current restrictions of the ARL at any point, including
             * during commissioning after joining the fabric.
             *
             * @see {@link MatterSpecification.v141.Core} § 9.10.4.2
