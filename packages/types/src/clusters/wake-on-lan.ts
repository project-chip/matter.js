     * This cluster provides an interface for managing low power mode on a device that supports the Wake On LAN or Wake
     * On Wireless LAN (WLAN) protocol (see [Wake On LAN]).
     *
     * This cluster would be supported on IP devices that have a low power mode AND support the ability to be woken up
     * using the Wake on LAN or Wake on WLAN protocol. This cluster provides the device MAC address which is a required
     * input to the Wake on LAN protocol. Besides the MAC address, this cluster provides an optional link-local IPv6
     * address which is useful to support "Wake on Direct Packet" used by some Ethernet and Wi-Fi devices.
     *
     * Acting on the MAC address or link-local IPv6 address information does require the caller to be in the same
     * broadcast domain as the destination. To wake the destination up, the caller sends a multicast-based magic UDP
     * packet that contains destination’s MAC address in the UDP payload to FF02::1, the IPv6 all-nodes link-local
     * multicast group address. If the optional link-local address is provided by the destination through this cluster,
     * the caller also sends the magic UDP packet in unicast to that link-local address. This unicast-based method is
     * particularly useful for Wi-Fi devices, since due to lack of MAC layer retransmission mechanism, multicast over
     * Wi-Fi is not as reliable as unicast. If a device provides the link-local address in this cluster, its Ethernet
     * controller or Wi-Fi radio shall respond to the IPv6 neighbor solicitation message for the link-local address
     * without the need to wake host CPU up. In order to receive the magic or neighbor solicitation packets in
     * multicast, the Wi-Fi devices must support Group Temporal Key (GTK) rekey operation in low power mode.
     *
     * Most devices automatically enter low power mode based upon inactivity.
     *
     * The cluster server for Wake on LAN or Wake on WLAN is implemented by a device that supports the Wake on LAN/WLAN
     * protocol, such as a TV, Set-top Box, or Smart Speaker.
     *
     * @see {@link MatterSpecification.v141.Cluster} § 1.12
