// Node makes it impossible to obtain the path of the current file in a matter that transpiles cleanly to both ESM and
// CJS.  __dirname is not available in ESM but you can't reference import.meta.url in CJS even conditionally because it
// is a compile-time error.  So instead we locate the root of the tools package in this file which always runs as CJS
// and is thus importable into both ESM and CJS.
