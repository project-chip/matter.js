         * This command is used by Administrators to set the state of a given Group Key Set, including atomically
         * updating the state of all epoch keys.
         *
         * Effect on Receipt
         *
         * The following validations shall be done against the content of the GroupKeySet field:
         *
         *   • If the EpochKey0 field is null or its associated EpochStartTime0 field is null, then this command shall
         *     fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.
         *
         *   • If the EpochKey0 field’s length is not exactly 16 bytes, then this command shall fail with a
         *     CONSTRAINT_ERROR status code responded to the client.
         *
         *   • If the EpochStartTime0 is set to 0, then this command shall fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code
         *     responded to the client. Note that internally, a GroupKeySetStruct’s EpochStartTime0 may be set to zero,
         *     due to the behavior of the AddNOC command which synthesizes a GroupKeySetStruct (see IPKValue). However,
         *     the value 0 is illegal in the GroupKeySet field sent by a client.
         *
         *   • If the EpochKey1 field is not null, then the EpochKey0 field shall NOT be null. Otherwise this command
         *     shall fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.
         *
         *   • If the EpochKey1 field is not null, and the field’s length is not exactly 16 bytes, then this command
         *     shall fail with a CONSTRAINT_ERROR status code responded to the client.
         *
         *   • If the EpochKey1 field is not null, its associated EpochStartTime1 field shall NOT be null and shall
         *     contain a later epoch start time than the epoch start time found in the EpochStartTime0 field. Otherwise
         *     this command shall fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.
         *
         *   • If exactly one of the EpochKey1 or EpochStartTime1 is null, rather than both being null, or neither being
         *     null, then this command shall fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.
         *
         *   • If the EpochKey2 field is not null, then the EpochKey1 and EpochKey0 fields shall NOT be null. Otherwise
         *     this command shall fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.
         *
         *   • If the EpochKey2 field is not null, and the field’s length is not exactly 16 bytes, then this command
         *     shall fail with a CONSTRAINT_ERROR status code responded to the client.
         *
         *   • If the EpochKey2 field is not null, its associated EpochStartTime2 field shall NOT be null and shall
         *     contain a later epoch start time than the epoch start time found in the EpochStartTime1 field. Otherwise
         *     this command shall fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.
         *
         *   • If exactly one of the EpochKey2 or EpochStartTime2 is null, rather than both being null, or neither being
         *     null, then this command shall fail with an INVALID_COMMAND status code responded to the client.
         *
         * If there exists a Group Key Set associated with the accessing fabric which has the same GroupKeySetID as that
         * provided in the GroupKeySet field, then the contents of that group key set shall be
         *
         * replaced. A replacement shall be done by executing the equivalent of entirely removing the previous Group Key
         * Set with the given GroupKeySetID, followed by an addition of a Group Key Set with the provided configuration.
         * Otherwise, if the GroupKeySetID did not match an existing entry, a new Group Key Set associated with the
         * accessing fabric shall be created with the provided data. The Group Key Set shall be written to non-volatile
         * storage.
         *
         * Upon completion, this command shall send a status code back to the initiator:
         *
         *   • If the Group Key Set was properly installed or updated on the Node, the status code shall be set to
         *     SUCCESS.
         *
         *   • If there are insufficient resources on the receiver to store an additional Group Key Set, the status code
         *     shall be set to RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED (see group key limits);
         *
         *   • Otherwise, this status code shall be set to FAILURE.
