        /**
         * Success or failure of this command shall be communicated by the ArmFailSafeResponse command, unless some data
         * model validations caused a failure status code to be issued during the processing of the command.
         *
         * If the fail-safe timer is not currently armed, the commissioning window is open, and the command was received
         * over a CASE session, the command shall leave the current fail-safe state unchanged and immediately respond
         * with an ArmFailSafeResponse containing an ErrorCode value of BusyWithOtherAdmin. This is done to allow
         * commissioners, which use PASE connections, the opportunity to use the failsafe during the relatively short
         * commissioning window.
         *
         * Otherwise, the command shall arm or re-arm the "fail-safe timer" with an expiry time set for a duration of
         * ExpiryLengthSeconds, or disarm it, depending on the situation:
         *
         *   • If ExpiryLengthSeconds is 0 and the fail-safe timer was already armed and the accessing fabric matches
         *     the Fabric currently associated with the fail-safe context, then the fail-safe timer shall be immediately
         *     expired (see further below for side-effects of expiration).
         *
         *   • If ExpiryLengthSeconds is 0 and the fail-safe timer was not armed, then this command invocation shall
         *     lead to a success response with no side-effects against the fail-safe context.
         *
         *   • If ExpiryLengthSeconds is non-zero and the fail-safe timer was not currently armed, then the fail-safe
         *     timer shall be armed for that duration.
         *
         *   • If ExpiryLengthSeconds is non-zero and the fail-safe timer was currently armed, and the accessing Fabric
         *     matches the fail-safe context’s associated Fabric, then the fail-safe timer shall be re- armed to expire
         *     in ExpiryLengthSeconds.
         *
         *   • Otherwise, the command shall leave the current fail-safe state unchanged and immediately respond with
         *     ArmFailSafeResponse containing an ErrorCode value of BusyWithOtherAdmin, indicating a likely conflict
         *     between commissioners.
         *
         * The value of the Breadcrumb field shall be written to the Breadcrumb on successful execution of the command.
         *
         * If the receiver restarts unexpectedly (e.g., power interruption, software crash, or other reset) the receiver
         * shall behave as if the fail-safe timer expired and perform the sequence of clean-up steps listed below.
         *
         * On successful execution of the command, the ErrorCode field of the ArmFailSafeResponse shall be set to OK.
         *
         * ### Fail Safe Context
         *
         * When first arming the fail-safe timer, a 'Fail Safe Context' shall be created on the receiver, to track the
         * following state information while the fail-safe is armed:
         *
         *   • The fail-safe timer duration.
         *
         *   • The state of all Network Commissioning Networks attribute configurations, to allow recovery of
         *     connectivity after Fail-Safe expiry.
         *
         *   • Whether an AddNOC command or UpdateNOC command has taken place.
         *
         *   • A Fabric Index for the fabric-scoping of the context, starting at the accessing fabric index for the
         *     ArmFailSafe command, and updated with the Fabric Index associated with an AddNOC command or an UpdateNOC
         *     command being invoked successfully during the ongoing Fail-Safe timer period.
         *
         *   • The operational credentials associated with any Fabric whose configuration is affected by the UpdateNOC
         *     command.
         *
         *   • Optionally: the previous state of non-fabric-scoped data that is mutated during the fail-safe period.
         *
         * Note the following to assist in understanding the above state-keeping, which summarizes other normative
         * requirements in the respective sections:
         *
         *   • The AddNOC command can only be invoked once per contiguous non-expiring fail-safe timer period, and only
         *     if no UpdateNOC command was previously processed within the same fail-safe timer period.
         *
         *   • The UpdateNOC command can only be invoked once per contiguous non-expiring fail-safe timer period, can
         *     only be invoked over a CASE session, and only if no AddNOC command was previously processed in the same
         *     fail-safe timer period.
         *
         * On creation of the Fail Safe Context a second timer shall be created to expire at
         * MaxCumulativeFailsafeSeconds as specified in BasicCommissioningInfo. This Cumulative Fail Safe Context timer
         * (CFSC timer) serves to limit the lifetime of any particular Fail Safe Context; it shall NOT be extended or
         * modified on subsequent invocations of ArmFailSafe associated with this Fail Safe Context. Upon expiry of the
         * CFSC timer, the receiver shall execute cleanup behavior equivalent to that of fail-safe timer expiration as
         * detailed in Section 11.10.7.2.2, “Behavior on expiry of Fail-Safe timer”. Termination of the session prior to
         * the expiration of that timer for any reason (including a successful end of commissioning or an expiry of a
         * fail-safe timer) shall also delete the CFSC timer.
         *
         * ### Behavior on expiry of Fail-Safe timer
         *
         * If the fail-safe timer expires before the CommissioningComplete command is successfully invoked, the
         * following sequence of clean-up steps shall be executed, in order, by the receiver:
         *
         *   1. Terminate any open PASE secure session by clearing any associated Secure Session Context at the Server.
         *
         *   2. Revoke the temporary administrative privileges granted to any open PASE session (see Section 6.6.2.9,
         *       “Bootstrapping of the Access Control Cluster”) at the Server.
         *
         *   3. If an AddNOC or UpdateNOC command has been successfully invoked, terminate all CASE sessions associated
         *       with the Fabric whose Fabric Index is recorded in the Fail-Safe context (see ArmFailSafe) by clearing
         *       any associated Secure Session Context at the Server.
         *
         *   4. Reset the configuration of all Network Commissioning Networks attribute to their state prior to the
         *       Fail-Safe being armed.
         *
         *   5. If an UpdateNOC command had been successfully invoked, revert the state of operational key pair, NOC and
         *       ICAC for that Fabric to the state prior to the Fail-Safe timer being armed, for the Fabric Index that
         *       was the subject of the UpdateNOC command.
         *
         *   6. If an AddNOC command had been successfully invoked, achieve the equivalent effect of invoking the
         *       RemoveFabric command against the Fabric Index stored in the Fail-Safe Context for the Fabric Index that
         *       was the subject of the AddNOC command. This shall remove all associations to that Fabric including all
         *       fabric-scoped data, and may possibly factory-reset the device depending on current device state. This
         *       shall only apply to Fabrics added during the fail-safe period as the result of the AddNOC command.
         *
         *   7. If the CSRRequest command had been successfully invoked, but no AddNOC or UpdateNOC command had been
         *       successfully invoked, then the new operational key pair temporarily generated for the purposes of NOC
         *       addition or update (see Node Operational CSR Procedure) shall be removed as it is no longer needed.
         *
         *   8. Remove any RCACs added by the AddTrustedRootCertificate command that are not currently referenced by any
         *       entry in the Fabrics attribute.
         *
         *   9. Reset the Breadcrumb attribute to zero.
         *
         *   10. Optionally: if no factory-reset resulted from the previous steps, it is recommended that the Node
         *       rollback the state of all non fabric-scoped data present in the Fail-Safe context.
         *
         * @see {@link MatterSpecification.v14.Core} § 11.10.7.2

         * An ErrorCode of NoFailSafe shall be responded to the invoker if the CommissioningComplete command was
         * received when no Fail-Safe context exists.

         * If Terms and Conditions are required, then an ErrorCode of TCAcknowledgementsNotReceived shall be responded
         * to the invoker if the user acknowledgements to the required Terms and Conditions have not been provided. If
         * the TCAcceptedVersion for the provided acknowledgements is less than TCMinRequiredVersion, then an ErrorCode

         *   • After an AddNOC command has been successfully invoked, the CommissioningComplete command must originate
         *     from the Fabric which was joined through the execution of that command, which updated the Fail-Safe
         *     context’s Fabric Index.
         *
         * On successful execution of the CommissioningComplete command, where the CommissioningCompleteResponse has an
         * ErrorCode of OK, the following actions shall be undertaken on the Server:
         *
         *   1. The Fail-Safe timer associated with the current Fail-Safe context shall be disarmed.
         *
         *   2. The commissioning window at the Server shall be closed.
         *
         *   3. Any temporary administrative privileges automatically granted to any open PASE session shall be revoked
         *      (see Section 6.6.2.9, “Bootstrapping of the Access Control Cluster”).
         *
