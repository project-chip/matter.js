/**
 * Two-phase commit implementation.
 *
 * Transactions are either shared (for reads) or exclusive (for writes). Exclusive transactions do not block shared
 * transactions but state updates will not be visible until the transaction completes.
 *
 * Writes do block other writes.  Transactions start automatically when a write occurs.  Since this usually happens
 * synchronously, the best Matter.js can do is throw an error if two write transactions would conflict.  However, you
 * can avoid this by using {@link begin} which will wait for other transactions to complete before acquiring resource
 * locks.
 *
 * Persistence is implemented by a list of participants.  Commits are two phase.  If an error throws in phase one all
 * participants roll back. An error in phase 2 could result in data inconsistency.
 *
 * TODO - does prevent deadlock but we should probably add a timeout for resource locking

     * exclusive transaction explicitly:
     *
     *   1. Automatic transactions are started in a synchronous context so conflicting transactions will throw an error.
     *      If you start a transaction, your code will await any transaction that would otherwise throw an error.
     *
     *   2. Transaction isolation means your view of data may become stale if a write occurs in another transaction.
     *      Once you start a transaction you block other writers so can be assured you're dealing with newest state.
     *
     *   3. Say transaction A has an exclusive lock on resource 1 and awaits resource 2.  Transaction B has an exclusive
     *      lock on resource 2. Transaction B cannot then await resource 1 without causing a deadlock.  Matter.js will
     *      detect the deadlock and throw an error. One way to prevent this is to begin a transaction and acquire locks
     *      in a specific order.
     *
     * None of the issues above are likely and are probably not a concern for your application.  If you do encounter
     * these issues the error message will suggest solutions.
